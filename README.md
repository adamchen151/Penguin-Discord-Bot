# Penguin Discord Bot

## Commands
- penguin: gives a 2-3 sentence summary of a penguin species generated by OpenAI
- population: gives the population of a penguin species
- challenge: rock-paper-scissors but with more options, and most of the options are penguin species
- button: gives the amount of times you've clicked the penguin button
- 8-ball: an 8-ball


It uses a lot of code from [this tutorial](https://github.com/discord/discord-example-app). All of the instructions on their README.md pretty much apply to this repo.  

Add it on Discord with the link https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1134599817390207056&permissions=2048&scope=applications.commands%20bot  
You can also view the code on Glitch [here](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/fine-splashy-haze).

This connects to a OpenAI API thingy, so if you don't have an OpenAI API key, uncomment the `export function getPenguinText(str)` block in utils.js, and
replace lines 56-67 in app.js to say `const text = getPenguinText(species)`. This will give pregenerated text instead of AI generated text.
